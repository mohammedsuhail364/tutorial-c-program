pointer in c:-
--------------
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int *a;
    
    int d=5;
    a =&d;
     
     printf("%d\n",a);
     printf("%d",*a);
     return 0;
}
note:&d - memory space in computer so it is saved in "a",but *a is the value of d so indicates *a also int .
*a is pointer
