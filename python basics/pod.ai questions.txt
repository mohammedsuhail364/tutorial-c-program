you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planned,and some are not.however cannot be planted in adjacent plots.given any integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's,where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty can be planted in the flowerbed without violating no adjacent flowers rule and false otherwise.

answer:-
--------

class solution:
    def flowerplacement(flowerbed:list[int],n:int)->bool:
        flowerbed=[0]+flowerbed+[0]
        flowerplanted=0
        for i in range(1,len(flowerbed)-1):
            if (flowerbed[i-1]==0 and flowerbed[i]==0 and flowerbed[i+1]==0):
                flowerbed[i]=1
                flowerplanted+=1
            if flowerplanted ==n:
                return True
        return False
a=solution
arr=list(map(int,input().split()))
n=int(input())
print(a.flowerplacement(arr,n))

output:-
-------

1 0 0 0 1
1
True  

2)An intelligence agency has received reports about some threats.the reports consist of numbers in a mysterious method.there is a number "N" and "R".those numbers are studied throughly and it is concluded that all digits of the number "N" are summed up and this action is performed R number of times.the resultants also a single digit that yet to be deciphered .the task here is to find the single digit sum of the given number 'N' by repeating the action "R"number of times

answer:-
-------

n=input()
r=int(input())
li=[]
sume=0
for i in n:
    li.append(int(i)) 
    
def fun(x):
    for i in str(x): 
        li.append(int(i)) 

for x in range(r): 
    sume=sum(li) 
    li.clear()
    fun(sume)
print(sume)
    
output:-
-------

99           1234
3            2
9            1

3)consider the following series:1,1,2,3,4,9,8,27,16.....

program:-
--------

n=int(input())
a=2
b=3
li=[]
for i in range(n):
    li.append(a)
    li.append(b)
    a*=2
    b*=3
li=[1]+[1]+li
print(li[n-1])
    
output:-
--------

10     16
81     2187

4)selection of MPC'S exams include a fitness test which is conducted on ground.there will be batch of 3 trainees,appearing for running test in track for 3 rounds.you need to record their oxygen level after every round.after trainee are finished with all three rounds,calculate for each trainee his average oxygen level over the 3 rounds and select one with highest oxygen level  as the most fit trainee.if more than one trainee attains the same highest average level,they all need to be selected

program:-
--------
li=[]
for i in range(9):
    li.append(int(input()))
m=max(li)
for i in range(9):
    if li[i]==m:
        print("Trainee Number :"+str(i+1))
    
answer:-
--------

95
90
92
93
84
95
94
94
60
Trainee Number :1
Trainee Number :6

5)given a list,the task is to write a python program to count the occurences of ith element before the first occurence of jth elements

answer:-
-------

n=list(map(int,input().split()))
i=int(input())
j=int(input())
count=0
for x in n:
    if x==i:
        count+=1
    elif x==8:
        break
print(count)


output:-
-------

4 5 6 4 1 4 8 5 4 3 4 9
4
8
3

6)given a list of words and a positive integer k write a python program to find k longest words in the list in decending order of length

answer:-
------

lst=list(map(str,input().split()))
k=int(input())
li=[]
for i in lst:
    if len(i)>k:
        li.append(i)
print(li)
lst.clear()
a=len(li)
for i in range(0,a):
    m=""
    for j in li:
        if(len(j)>len(m)):
            m=j
    lst.append(m)
    li.remove(m)
print(lst)
        
output:-
-------
